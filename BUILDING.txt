To reproduce the build in a container defined by the attached Dockerfile, run:

```
./build.sh
```

At the end of the process this will print the SHA256 checksum of the
shimx64.efi binary that was just built, as well as copy the file to the current
directory and verify its checksum against the attached shimx64.efi.sha256 file.
